# MOHAF: Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction Framework

## Overview
This repository provides the implementation and supporting materials for the paper:

"MOHAF: A Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction Framework for Scalable and Fair Resource Allocation in IoT Ecosystems"

MOHAF is a distributed resource allocation mechanism for heterogeneous IoT environments.  
It combines hierarchical clustering, submodular optimization, and dynamic pricing to achieve:

- Efficient allocation of resources in large-scale IoT ecosystems  
- Joint optimization of cost, energy efficiency, quality of service (QoS), and fairness  
- Theoretical guarantees with a (1 - 1/e) approximation ratio  
- Perfect fairness across participants (Jain’s Index = 1.000 in experiments)  

We provide code, experimental setup, and references to enable reproducibility and extension of this work.
